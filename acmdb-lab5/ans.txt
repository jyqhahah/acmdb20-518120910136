1.Design decisions:
Cycle-detection in dependency graph structure has been implemented to detect deadlock. There are two type of lock, SHARED and EXCLUSIVE. The locking granularity is at page level.

2.API changes:
None.

3.Missing or incomplete:
seems not

4.Time spent:
4 days. I spent a lot of time to debug the code of multi-thread transactions. The most difficult thing is to design the lock manager.
