1.Design decisions:
(1)Exercise 1: use ArrayList to implement tupleDesc
(2)Exercise 2: use built-in class CatalogItem to store the imformation of a table
(3)Exercise 3: use a Hashmap to map from pageId to page
(4)Exercise 4: use class TupleIterator to get a iterator
(5)Exercise 5: use class HeapFileIterator to get a HeapFile iterator
(6)Exercise 6: use DBFileIterator to iterator the tuple


2.API changes:
nothing special

3.Missing or incomplete:
seems to be none

4.Time spent:
3 days. And there was not anything very difficult.
